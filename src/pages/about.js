I am a Computer Science Engineer currently based out of the greater Philidelphia area, but I am able to relocate. I am currently applying to jobs in the following fields: Information Technology, Data Science, Cloud Computing, Network engineering, Web Development and Software Engineering.
                        I made this page to better introduce myself and the projects I am working on.
                        Just click the buttons above to check out my projects. 
                        There are also links to my resume, github and linkedin below

                        &emsp;In addition to technology and coding, I have a passion for environmental studies and issues. 
                        I hope to one day use my Lehigh Computer Science and Engineering degree to develop software to help the environment. 
                        I was one of the captains of my highschool swim team senior year and have continued to swim to this day. 
                        Music has also had a large influence on my life and I have learned to play the guitar and drums.
